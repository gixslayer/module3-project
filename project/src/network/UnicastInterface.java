		// For some reason the send call in the commented code below was causing huge stalls (several hundred milliseconds per call)
		// for the users running the live-USB. I didn't experience any issues on my own machine running Mint 17.1 natively. I'm not sure
		// if this is caused by the live-USB or distro used (or anything else for that matter). My best guess is that some kind of kernel
		// buffer (which the data would normally be copied in) is full and the call blocks until the queue is (partially) flushed. We could
		// somewhat work around this issue by trying to limit how much send calls we make, but as the stalls were causing massive delays in
		// our application leading to all sorts of issues we're pushing all send calls into our own queue, which is polled on another thread.
		// This way minor stalls won't be an issue. Big stalls are still problematic as the queue would develop a large backlog and the
		// effective network latency will be unacceptably large. It's also bound to cause issues in the TCP layer (due to retransmission timeouts).
		// This solution is a bit of a hack, but should work sufficiently for our purposes. We are short on time so we have to prioritize other
		// things, even if this isn't ideal sadly enough.
